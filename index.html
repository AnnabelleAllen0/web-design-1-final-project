        <h1>Hello and welcome to my bio!</h1>
        <h2>About Me.</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Annabelle Allen and I am currently a student of Graphic
          Design at Algonquin College. <br>
          Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design
          principles and have gained experience with a variety of design tools,
          including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign),
          Figma, and Sketch. <br>
          I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have
          also had the opportunity to experiment with other areas of design, such
          as motion graphics and web design.

              <h2>Logo Creation</h2>
              <p>Your logo is the face of your brand and the first thing that potential 
                  customers will see, so it's crucial to make a great first impression. 
                  I can help create a logo that is both visually stunning and effective 
                  in representing your brand. <br>

              <h2>Web Design</h2>
              <p>Your website is often the first interaction customers have with your 
                  business, so it's important to make a strong first impression. I can 
                  help you create a website that not only looks great but also functions 
                  flawlessly and engages your target audience. <br>

              <h2>Full Branding</h2>
            <p>Your brand is much more than just a logo or a website. It's the overall 
                image that your business presents to the world, including the look, feel, 
                and voice of your brand. I can help you create a cohesive and impactful 
                brand that resonates with your target audience and sets you apart from 
                your competitors. <br>
